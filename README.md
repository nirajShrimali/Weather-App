Backend Workflow
API Integration with Volley
The app integrates with the WeatherAPI service using the Volley library for network requests.
A GET request is sent to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts.
Example API call:
The API Response Includes:
Current Weather:

Temperature (temp_c)
Weather condition (condition.text)
Weather icon (condition.icon)
Day/Night indicator (is_day)
Hourly Forecast:

Time (time)
Temperature (temp_c)
Wind speed (wind_kph)
Weather condition (condition.text)
Icon (condition.icon)
Data Parsing
The JSON response is parsed to extract the required data.

Example JSON snippet for the hourly forecast:

json
Copy code
{
  "time": "2025-01-07 12:00",
  "temp_c": 25.6,
  "wind_kph": 10.5,
  "condition": {
    "text": "Sunny",
    "icon": "//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png"
  }
}
Parsed data is used to populate forecastRVModal objects and displayed using WeatherRVAdapter.

RecyclerView for Forecast Display
The hourly weather data is dynamically loaded into a RecyclerView for a scrollable view of the forecast.
Each item in the RecyclerView displays:
Time
Temperature
Weather icon
Wind speed
Dynamic Weather Icons
Weather condition icons are fetched dynamically using Picasso.
Example:
java
Copy code
Picasso.get().load("https:" + conditionIcon).into(tempImg);
Search Bar Functionality
Users can enter a city name in the search bar, triggering a new API call for that city.
The UI updates dynamically to display the selected city's weather details.
Error handling ensures users are notified if an invalid city name is entered.
Location-Based Weather
The app uses LocationManager and Geocoder to fetch the user's current coordinates.
These coordinates are used to determine the city and fetch local weather details.
